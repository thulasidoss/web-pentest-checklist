# Pentesting Web checklist			
			
## Recon phase	

- Large scope	
    - Get ASN for IP ranges (amass, asnlookup, metabigor, bgp)	
		- Review latest acquisitions	
		- Get relationships by registrants (viewdns)	
		- Go to medium scope for each domain	
- Medium scope	Enumerate subdomains (amass or subfinder with all available API keys)	
		- Subdomain bruteforce (puredns with wordlist)	
		- Permute subdomains (gotator or ripgen with wordlist)	
		- Identify alive subdomains (httpx)	
		- Subdomain takeovers (nuclei-takeovers)	
		- Check for cloud assets (cloudenum)	
		- Shodan search	
		- Transfer zone	
		- Subdomains recursive search	
		- Take screenshots (gowitness, webscreenshot, aquatone)	
- Small scope	
    - Identify web server, technologies and database (httpx)	
		- Try to locate /robots.txt , /crossdomain.xml /clientaccesspolicy.xml /sitemap.xml and /.well-known/	
		- Review comments on source code (Burp Engagement Tools)	
		- Directory enumeration	
		- Web fuzzing (ffuf and wordlist)	
		- Find leaked ids, emails (pwndb)	
		- Identify WAF (whatwaf, wafw00f)	
		- Google dorking	
		- GitHub dorking/Github tools (githound, gitdorks_go)	
		- Get urls (gau , waybackurls, gospider)	
		- Check potential vulnerable urls (gf-patterns)	
		- Automatic XSS finder (dalfox)	
		- Locate admin and login panel	
		- Broken link hijacking (blc)	
- Network	
    - Check ICMP packets allowed	
		- Check DMARC/SPF policies (spoofcheck)	
		- Open ports with Shodan	
		- Port scan to all ports	
		- Check UDP ports (udp-proto-scanner or nmap)	
		- Test SSL (testssl)	
		- If got creds, try password spraying for all the services discovered	
- Preparation	
    - Study site structure	
		- Make a list with all possible test cases	
		- Understand the business area and what their customer needs	
		- Get a list of every asset (all_subdomains.txt, live_subdomains.txt, waybackurls.txt, hidden_directories.txt, nmap_results.txt, GitHub_search.txt, altdns_subdomain.txt, vulnerable_links.txt, js_files.txt)
